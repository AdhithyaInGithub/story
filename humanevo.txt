people say that humans are evolved from monkeys. and researchers has a lot of evidence in the form of skeletons and fossils
but i am not convinced by the fact that their studies shows this. i want to be able to time travel inorder to believe that.
  the only wat in which i can time travel is by creating a distortion in the quantum adreance of my time line and create a 
temp-warp in the space time and catchup to the light rays emitted from the earth surface millions of years ago. by doing this,
  i could see the photons of that time line and see what the past was like. but like in sci-fi movies, i would not be able to intract 
in that timeline, since i am only watching the old photons.
